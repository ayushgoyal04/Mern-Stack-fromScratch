Runnign a full stack application means runnign multiple servers. There can be any issue or bug on any of these servers. So we need to maintain logs so that we can pinpoint the issue.

Types of logs->
1. INFO
2. WARNING
3. ERROR

In all the logs, information is saved in a file (traditional) but nowdays we want to save the logs in the database.
